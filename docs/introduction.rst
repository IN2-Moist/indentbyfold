Introduction
============

IndentByFold is a plug-in for `Notepad++`_. It uses fold points to indent the
code. So if the fold level increases or decreases, so should the indentation.


Installation Note
-----------------

For the plug-in to work properly it is important to disable Notepad++'s
built-in Auto Indent. Go to ``Settings`` - ``Preferences`` - ``MISC`` and
untick ``Auto Indent``.


History

plug-in. He released three version, up till 0.7. But since then he switched
away from Notepad++ and stopped developing his plug-ins. In April 2013
Frank Fesevur took over the maintenance of the plug-in.
